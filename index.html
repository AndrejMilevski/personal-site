                <h3>Tennis</h3>
                <p>I love playing tennis in my free time. Tennis is not just a sport for me but a way to stay active and
                    healthy. The thrill of a good rally, the satisfaction of a well-placed shot, and the joy of winning
                    a
                    tough match are unparalleled. I play tennis regularly at my local club, and I also enjoy watching
                    major
                    tournaments like Wimbledon and the US Open. Tennis has taught me the importance of perseverance,
                    strategy, and sportsmanship.</p>

                <h3>Computer Games</h3>
                <p>I enjoy playing computer games, especially strategy and puzzle games. These games provide a mental
                    challenge and help improve my problem-solving skills. Whether it's building a virtual empire,
                    solving
                    intricate puzzles, or competing in fast-paced action games, I find gaming to be a great way to relax
                    and
                    unwind. I often play with friends online, which adds a social element to the experience. Gaming also
                    keeps me updated with the latest technology and trends in the gaming industry.</p>

                <h3>Chess</h3>
                <p>Chess is a great way to improve my strategic thinking and problem-solving skills. I started playing
                    chess
                    at a young age and have always been fascinated by its complexity and depth. Every game is a new
                    challenge that requires careful planning and foresight. I participate in local chess clubs and
                    tournaments, where I enjoy testing my skills against other enthusiasts. Chess has not only sharpened
                    my
                    mind but also taught me patience and the value of thinking ahead.</p>

            <h3>Elementary School</h3>
            <p>I attended OU "Todor Angelevski" in Bitola, where I built the foundation of my education. During these
                formative years, I developed a love for learning and curiosity about the world. My teachers played a
                crucial role in nurturing my academic interests and encouraging me to explore various subjects.
                Participating in school activities and projects helped me build essential skills in communication,
                teamwork, and critical thinking.</p>

            <p>At DSU "Sports Academy", I furthered my education and honed my skills in various disciplines. High school
                was a time of growth and exploration, where I took on more challenging courses and extracurricular
                activities. I was actively involved in clubs and sports, which helped me develop leadership skills and a
                sense of responsibility. The experiences and knowledge gained during high school have been invaluable in
                shaping my academic and personal goals.</p>
